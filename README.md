- This repository is an implementation of the Total Variation (l1-TV) method for image denoising. 
- The code has been written in python 3.
- Video 1: image + impulse noise
- Video 2: image + Gaussian noise 
- Run img_denoising_TV.py
- l1-TV is the solution to the following optimization problem in which the regularization term is the l1 norm of the gradient of the desired image:

- The solution is based on the Euler-Lagrange equation.
